		    <h2>About</h2>
		    <div class="grey-box">IMAGE</div>
		    <p> 
		    	I am a full stack developer with 3 years of experience, currently working in Javascript, AngularJs, Express, NodeJs, MongoDB, and jQuery but always interested in learning more. I enjoy writing clean code, using new technologies, and leveraging the power of code to connect people. I also enjoy the continual learning that programming brings. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
					Past experience in customer service and non-profit work, as well as living in a few countries, has taught me how to communicate effectively and adapt in order to be successful in various work environments.  As a developer, I bring these skills along with passion, dedication and self-awareness to the work I do. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time outdoors, watching college football (Go Dawgs!), traveling and reading good books.
